              What? This tool converts your feedback thoughts into a format following the following structure =>
          
              Information:
              - Clearly describe the specific behavior or situation without judgment. Stick to factual observations.
              - Provide concrete examples to illustrate the behavior. Be precise with details.
              Importance:
              - Explain why the behavior matters. Focus on its impact, relevance to goals, or connection to important values.
              - Frame the importance constructively, not punitively. Avoid scolding or shaming.
              
              Invitation to Change:
              - Invite dialogue and solicit the person's perspective. Ask open-ended questions.
              - Suggest alternatives, but don't dictate. Say "You may want to try..." not "You should..."
              - Offer support and express willingness to help implement changes.
          
              Implications:
              - Discuss logical consequences, both positive and negative, of continuing current behavior.
              - Frame implications in a motivational way focused on growth.
              - Bring the conversation back to shared goals and values.
          
              The key is to give balanced, compassionate, thoughtful feedback that inspires improvement. Present information objectively, explain why it matters, invite participation in solutions, and share natural implications.
          
              If you want to dive deep into the science of receiving feedback then I highly recommend this book: "Thanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well" https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Feedback-Science-Receiving-Well/dp/0670014664
